# 3d-2

Old README:
The first 3D was just by reading Wikipedia articles, which is hardly helpful. I have borrowed the book "Computer Graphics from Scratch: A Programmer's Introduction to 3D Rendering" from the library. This is what I will use for this.

This project uses SDL2 to implement a `PutPixel()` function. I can't think of another way to do this. It also has an interface to keyboard and mouse which could be helpful.

Update:
This project was originally abandoned on creation, but now it is being done as a school project. This is a retry of a previous project.
